# Salt AI: Core Concepts

Welcome to Salt AI! This guide introduces you to the fundamental concepts and terminology you'll encounter while using our platform. Understanding these core concepts will help you navigate Salt AI more effectively and build powerful AI-driven applications.

## Workflows

[https://app.salt.ai/workflows](https://app.salt.ai/workflows)

A workflow is the central element in Salt AI. It's a visual representation of an AI-driven process, composed of interconnected nodes that define a series of operations.

**Key aspects of workflows:**

- Visual programming interface
- Modular and customizable
- Represent complex AI processes without coding

## Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. Each node represents a specific function or operation within your AI process.

**Types of nodes include:**

- Input nodes (e.g., SaltInput)
- Processing nodes
- AI model nodes
- Output nodes (e.g., SaltOutput)

## Connections

Connections are the links between nodes that define how data flows through your workflow. They determine the order of operations and how information is passed from one node to another.

## AI Models

AI models are pre-trained machine learning models that can be integrated into your workflows. Salt AI supports various types of models for tasks such as:

- Image generation
- Natural language processing
- Audio processing
- And more

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs:** Data or parameters that your workflow processes. These can be defined using SaltInput nodes.

- **Outputs:** The results produced by your workflow, typically generated by SaltOutput nodes.

## Execution

Execution is the process of running a workflow. During execution, data flows through the nodes in your workflow, with each node performing its designated operation.

## Workflow Sharing

Salt AI enables easy workflow sharing through:

- JSON export of entire workflows
- Embedding workflow data in output images
- Drag-and-drop recreation of workflows from output images

Understanding these core concepts will provide you with a solid foundation for working with Salt AI. As you explore the platform, you'll discover how these elements work together to create powerful, flexible AI applications.
