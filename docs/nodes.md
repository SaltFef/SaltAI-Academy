# Understanding Nodes in Salt AI

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of workflows in Salt AI. Each node represents a specific function or operation, allowing you to create complex AI applications through visual programming. This guide will help you understand what nodes are, how to use them, and how to leverage Salt AI's unique node features.

## What are Nodes?

In Salt AI, nodes are modular components that perform specific tasks within a workflow. They can:

- Process data
- Apply AI models
- Transform inputs
- Generate outputs
- Control flow of operations

Nodes are connected to form a workflow, with data flowing from one node to the next.

## Extensive Node Library

Salt AI provides a vast library of pre-installed nodes, giving you access to over 1,600 community-contributed nodes. This extensive collection covers a wide range of functionalities, enabling you to build sophisticated AI applications without starting from scratch.

### Node Categories
