# Salt v1.0 Migration Guide

With the launch of Salt v1.0, we understand you may have questions about transitioning your existing workflows. This guide will help you understand your options and choose the best path forward.

## Understanding the Changes

Salt v1.0 represents a complete platform rebuild with a new node catalog that offers improved functionality and performance.Additionally, we have made the decision to not support many of the community nodes and models that we had previously. As a result, workflows built on previous versions are not directly compatible with the new platform.

## Your Migration Options

### 1. Export and Preserve Your Workflows

- All existing workflows can be exported as ComfyUI-compatible JSON files
- This preserves your work and enables transition to alternative platforms
- Export process is available through your Salt workflows dashboard in the `...` menu.

### 2. Choose Your Hosting Solution
